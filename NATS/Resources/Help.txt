NATS is a basic plain text file scanner.
 Usage: NATS -P <path> -K <keyword> [options]
 Keyword Options--------------------------------------------------------------
 Keywords can be any group of words, including spaces. The | character will be
 used as a seperator of keywords unless the -| option is used

 Paths Options----------------------------------------------------------------
 You can also pass in more then one path location to scan by using the | 
 seperator. This is NOT disabled with the -| option

 Options-----------------------------------------------------------------
 -K [keyword]<req> Keyword text to search for
 -P [path] <req>
 -S                Scans all Subdirectories of the Paths Table, as well as its root
 -T[X]             Implements Multithreading Scanning, with X being the number of 
                   Threads. If empty, it will be set to 4 
 -M                Implements "Smart Search" which uses the byte order mark at the start
                   of the file to assist in filtering out non text files. This process is
                   not 100% accurate.
 -R                Loads files under 10MB into Ram for Comparision. This was implemented
                   because I noticed NVME drives would spike some machines, which appeared
                   to be related to the ReadLines. Does Not work the the -L command yet.
 -O[path]          Will output the command to the specified path file
 -B [ext]          Implements a Blacklist of file extentions not to scan. 
                   extentions will be deliminated with the | symbol. NAPS has a default
                   blacklist of [7z|bmp|doc|docx|jpg|m4v|mov|mp3|mp4|pdf|png|tmp|xls|xlsx] 
                   and implementing this will override the default
 -W [SearchPatern] The search string to match against the names of files in path. 
                   This parameter can contain a combination of valid literal path 
                   and wildcard (* and ?) characters, but it doesn't support 
                   regular expressions.
 -L                By default NATS will only indicate if the file contains the selected 
                   keyword. Adding the L keyword will indicate What lines in the file the
                   keyword appears as well (Note: this search will take longer as it needs
                   to read through the entire file for keywords)
-H                 Ignores all other Inputs and displays this help file
