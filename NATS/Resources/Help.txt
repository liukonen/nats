 Search Types-----------------------------------------------------------------
 -T[X]            Threading: Not setting the value indicates a single thread 
                  search. -T Implements Multithreading Scanning, with X being
                  the number of Threads. If not set, single thread is used. If 
                  [X] is empty, it will be set to 4 threads.

 -I               Index: Will generate or refresh NATS Sqlite DB based on
                  the directory given. It will then search said index for any 
                  matching keywords in files, and scan that file for a match to
                  the phrase supplied.

 -L               Limited: Performs the same search as Index, but will not 
                  generate or refresh its index.

 -B               Build: Indexes on a directory only. A keyword needs to be 
                  passed but is not used in the action of indexing.  
                  Indexing also defaults to a hard coded set of file types 
                  that are whitelisted, blacklisted, and used "Smart Search" 
                  in order to scan the files. There is a chance Indexing will 
                  not always pick up on text files.

 -W               Windows Index: uses Windows build in Indexing engine to find 
                  files. Indexing must be turned on, and set in the 
                  folder you want to search through in order for this to work.

 Options----------------------------------------------------------------------

 -S              Smart Search: uses the byte order mark at the start of the 
                 file to assist in filtering out non text files. This process 
                 is not 100% accurate, however is set for index based searchs.

 -R              RAM: Loads files under 10MB into Ram for Comparision. This 
                 in theory should reduce IO spikes on the System process on 
                 non indexed searchs.Does Not work the the -L command.

 -O[path]        Output: Will output the command to the specified path file

 -D [ext]        Disapproved Extentions: Implements filtering of file 
                 extentions not to scan. Multiple extentions will be 
                 deliminated with the | symbol. NAPS has a default blacklist 
                 of [7z|bmp|db|db-journal|dll|doc|docx|exe|jpg|m4v|mov|mp3|mp4
                 |pdb|pdf|png|tmp|xls|xlsx|zip] and invoking this will 
                 override the default

 -A [ext]        Approved Extentions: The reverse of the disapproved 
                 extention, which is disabled if -A is sent. Will only search 
                 files with the perticular extention.

 -M              MultiLine: By default NATS will only indicate if the file 
                 contains the selected keyword. Adding the M keyword on 
                 Single or Multithread scan will indicate What lines in the 
                 file the keyword appears as well (Note: this search will take
                 longer as it needs to read through the entire file for 
                 keywords)

 -H              Ignores all other Inputs and displays this help file
