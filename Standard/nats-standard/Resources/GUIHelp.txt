NATS is a basic plain text file scanner.

Search Types------------------
- Threading: Implements Multithreading Scanning. By default it is set to 4 threads.
- Single:    Searchs your file system using only one thread.
 
Options-----------------------
- Smart Search (windows only): uses the byte order mark at the start of the file to assist in filtering out non text files. This process is not 100% accurate, however is set for index based search.

- RAM: Loads files under 10MB into Ram for comparison. This in theory should reduce IO spikes on the System process on 
-Disapproved Extensions (win only): Implements filtering of file extensions not to scan. 
    *NAPS has a default blacklist of 7z,bmp,db,db-journal,dll,doc,docx,exe,jpg,m4v,mov,mp3,mp4,pdb,pdf,png,tmp,xls,xlsx,zip, 
-Approved Extensions(win only): The reverse of the disapproved
-MultiLine: By default NATS will only indicate if the file  contains the selected keyword. Adding the M keyword on Single or Multithread scan will indicate What lines in the file the keyword appears as well (Note: this search will take longer as it needs to read through the entire file for keywords)
